## We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. Why does this matter? It matters to me, because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble, trouble certainly in how we relate to each other, but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection. 
## We're getting used to a new way of being alone together. People want to be with each other, but also elsewhere -- connected to all the different places they want to be. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all places they are. because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention.So you want to go to that board meeting, but you  only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. And some people think that's a good thing.
